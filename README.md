# pointless-game
Using NodeJS, I created a pointless multiplayer game.

Move a box with arrow keys and move a colored mouse other players can see.
The colored mouse only works with the first 4 players.

## Installation
You must have node and npm installed.

In the console, type `npm install`

## Run
To run, type `node app.js`

Use Ctrl+C or Control+C to exit.
